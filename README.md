### **Project Creation**

The project was started by navigating to the [template --- link needed](https://github) and clicking 'Use this template'. Under Repository name I input woodworking-club and checked the 'Include all branches' checkbox. I then navigated to the new [repository --- link needed](). I then clicked the Code drop down and selected HTTPS and copied the link to the clipboard.

Opening [Codeanywhere](https://app.codeanywhere.com/) and clicking 'New Workspace', I then pasted the [repository link --- link needed](https://github) into the URL field and clicked 'Create'. The following commands were used throughout the project:

+ git add filename - This command was used to add files to the staging area before committing.
+ git commit -m *commit message explaining the updates* - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository.
+ git push - This command is used to push all committed changes to the GitHub repository.
